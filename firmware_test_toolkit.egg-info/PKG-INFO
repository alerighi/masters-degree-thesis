# Master's degree thesis

In this repository there are the files for my master's degree thesis on automated testing of devices firmware

## Installation

This software requires python 3.11. Once installed, create a virtual environment, then just run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

to install the software in development mode.

Everything that is needed is in the `pyproject.toml` file, that specifies all the project dependencies and stuff.
